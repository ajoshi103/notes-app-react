Here's a README file for your project, explaining how to set it up and use it:

Notes App
This project is a simple Notes App built with React, where you can add, view, and delete notes. It uses an API to fetch and store notes, and falls back to local storage in case of a server error.

Features
Add Notes: Add a new note with content, which is stored on the server and displayed in real-time.
Delete Notes: Delete specific notes, which removes them from the server or local storage.
Fallback: In case of server unavailability, notes are saved and loaded from the browser's local storage.
Technologies
Frontend: React, CSS
Backend (assumed): Node.js/Express (running at localhost:3001)
HTTP Client: Axios
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the server:

This project assumes a backend server running at http://localhost:3001. If you don't have one, you can create an Express server with endpoints to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests for /notes.

Run the project:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Open the app: The app should open automatically at http://localhost:3000.
Add a Note: Type into the input field and click Add Note to create a new note.
Delete a Note: Click the trash icon next to a note to delete it.
Note: If the server is unavailable, notes are saved in local storage.

Scripts
Start the application: npm start
Build the application: npm run build

Technologies
Frontend: React, CSS
Backend: Node.js/Express, SQL database
HTTP Client: Axios
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the SQL Database:

Ensure you have an SQL database running, with tables set up to store notes. Update the server's database configuration (typically in a .env file) with your SQL credentials.

Set up the backend server:

The project assumes a backend server running at http://localhost:3001. The server should connect to your SQL database to handle GET, POST, and DELETE requests for /notes.

Run the project:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Open the app: The app should open automatically at http://localhost:3000.
Add a Note: Type into the input field and click Add Note to create a new note.
Delete a Note: Click the trash icon next to a note to delete it.
